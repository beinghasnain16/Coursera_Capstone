    "According to the United Nations, the United States has the highest number of immigrants and most of the immigrants settle in New York metropolitan area. Therefore as lots of people are migrating to various states of USA in particular NY, so they have to do alot of research in order to find out which neighbourhood is best for them. The purpose of this Project is to help people in exploring better facilities around their neighborhood.\n",

    "This aim of this project is to create comparative analysis between different neighbourhoods of New York City in order ti find the best neighbourhood for ease of accessing to schools, hospitals, grocery shops, super markets, malls, theatres etc. It will help people making smart and efficient decision on selecting great neighborhood out of numbers of other neighborhoods in New York City."

    "### Neighbourhood Data\n",
    "New York City has a total of 5 boroughs and 306 neighborhoods. In order to segement the neighborhoods and explore them, we will essentially need a dataset that contains the 5 boroughs and the neighborhoods that exist in each borough as well as the the latitude and logitude coordinates of each neighborhood. Luckily, this dataset exists for free on the web. Here is the link to the dataset: https://geo.nyu.edu/catalog/nyu_2451_34572\n",

    "### Foursquare API Data\n",
    "As we need data about differnet venues in different neighbourhoods therefore after finding the list of neighborhoods, we then connect to the Foursquare API to gather information about venues inside each and every neighborhood. For each neighborhood, we have chosen the radius to be 100 meter thus we will use the Foursquare API to explore neighborhoods in New York City. We will use the explore function to get the most common venue categories in each neighborhood."
